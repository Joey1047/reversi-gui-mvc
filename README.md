# Reversi (Othello) — Independent Java Implementation

This project is a standalone implementation of the Reversi game
developed independently in Java. The goal of the project was to
design and implement full gameplay logic, board state updates,
and UI-controller interaction using a clean modular structure.

##  Features
- Full Reversi rules implementation
- Move validation and piece-flipping logic
- Turn state control and end-game detection
- Basic AI opponent support (ReversiAI.java)
- MVC-style separation between Model / View / Controller

##  Design Highlights
- `ReversiBoard` manages board state and legal move search
- `ReversiController` coordinates game flow and user actions
- `ReversiModel` tracks game status and scores
- Emphasis on readability and maintainability
